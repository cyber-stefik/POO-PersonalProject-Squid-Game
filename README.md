This is a project in which I'll implement a few games from the famous
show "Squid Game" with different strategies.

First game is Red Light Green Light and all players with an even number
will die.
Second game is Tug of War where the team (composed of 4 players) with
the lower weight dies.
Third game is Marbles where players (2 everytime) will get a random
number and the player with the lower number will get to the final
game.
Fourth game is Genken (rock, paper, scissors) and there will be only
one left in the end.
